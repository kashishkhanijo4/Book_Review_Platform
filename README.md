# Book Review Platform

## Description

The Book Review Platform is a web application that allows users to search for books, read and write reviews, and rate books. It integrates with an external API (e.g., Google Books API) to fetch detailed information about books. Users can create accounts, maintain a list of favorite books, and interact with other users by reading their reviews and ratings.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system for users.
- **Search Functionality**: Allows users to search for books by title, author, or ISBN using an external API.
- **Book Details**: Displays detailed information about a book, including title, author, description, and cover image.
- **Reviews and Ratings**: Users can write reviews and rate books. They can also read reviews written by other users.
- **Favorite Books**: Users can add books to their list of favorites.
- **User Profiles**: Each user has a profile page displaying their reviews, ratings, and favorite books.
- **Responsive Design**: Accessible on various devices such as desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language for backend development.
- **Django**: High-level Python web framework for handling server-side logic, database operations, and the overall application framework.
- **HTML**: Structure the content of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Style and layout the web pages to make them visually appealing and user-friendly.
- **JavaScript**: Enhance user interactivity and handle dynamic updates.
- **RESTful API Integration**: Fetch book details from external sources such as the Google Books API.

## How it Works

### User Interface

- A search bar for entering the book title, author, or ISBN.
- Book detail pages that display information fetched from the external API.
- Forms for writing reviews and rating books.
- User profile pages showing user-specific data.

### Backend

- Django views to handle user authentication, book search, and review submission.
- Integration with the Google Books API to fetch book data.
- Models for managing user data, book reviews, and ratings.

### Frontend

- **HTML** for the basic structure of the web pages.
- **CSS** for styling the application.
- **JavaScript** to handle dynamic updates such as search results and review submissions without reloading the page.

## Project Structure

- **Authentication System**: Implement user registration, login, logout, and profile management using Django's built-in authentication system.
- **API Integration**: Use the Google Books API to fetch and display book details.
- **Review and Rating System**: Allow users to write reviews and rate books. Implement CRUD operations for reviews and ratings.
